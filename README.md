# Internal Audit Checklist for Botium Toys
# Step-by-Step Guidance:
Review the Scope and Goals:

The audit focuses on securing the company’s infrastructure, mitigating risks, threats, and vulnerabilities, and ensuring compliance with regulations related to processing online payments and conducting business in the E.U.

Pay close attention to areas where compliance risks may arise, like GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) or PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard).

Analyze the Risk Assessment:

Review the identified risks and vulnerabilities from the assessment. For example:

Are there gaps in infrastructure security?

Are there weaknesses in the IT team's ability to scale systems for global operations?

Do they have proper protocols for payment processing security, and do they align with E.U. regulations?

Perform Controls and Compliance Checklist:

Using the NIST Cybersecurity Framework, evaluate Botium Toys' existing controls across the framework’s core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.

Check compliance with key regulatory standards:

PCI DSS: Ensure secure payment processing infrastructure is in place.

GDPR: Verify that customer data is handled per E.U. regulations.

Assess controls like firewalls, encryption protocols, monitoring systems, and incident response plans.
